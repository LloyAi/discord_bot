Contextual Memory: Add a short-term memory for each user session, allowing the bot to maintain context across multiple interactions within a session.
Command Parsing Optimization: Implement natural language processing (NLP) techniques to improve the bot's ability to recognize commands and respond more intuitively.

4. done_command.py

Task Queuing and History: Develop a task queuing and tracking system, enabling users to view their pending or completed tasks and improve the bot’s task management capabilities.
User-Specific Task Management: Allow users to manage their tasks (like canceling or re-running completed tasks) to improve control over bot interactions.
Automated Reminders: Add automated reminders for incomplete tasks or tasks requiring additional user input, keeping the user informed without prompting them repeatedly.

5. embedding_handler.py

Cache Frequent Embeddings: Implement a caching layer for frequently accessed embeddings, reducing latency and database load.
Embedding Quality Metrics: Add functionality to evaluate the quality of embeddings, helping to ensure that the vector representations are accurate and meaningful.
Integration with Milvus: Improve integration with Milvus by adding connection pooling and error-handling mechanisms to optimize performance and reliability.
Batch Embedding Generation: Introduce batch processing for generating embeddings, which can optimize performance when handling large texts or multiple documents.

6. extract_equations.py

LaTeX Support: Add LaTeX support for equation formatting and interpretation, making it easier for users to input complex mathematical expressions.
Enhanced Equation Parsing: Improve equation recognition by expanding the types of equations or symbols supported (e.g., matrices, integrals, or summations).
Equation Result Interpretation: Add a feature to interpret the extracted equation and return relevant information or solutions, if applicable.
Error Handling for Complex Formats: Add error-handling mechanisms for complex or poorly formatted equations, providing helpful feedback to the user on how to improve input format.

7. file_reader_handler.py

Add Support for More File Types: Expand supported file types to include CSV, JSON, and Markdown, broadening the bot's capabilities for handling data.
Content Summarization: Implement a summarization feature that provides an overview of long documents, helping users to quickly understand content.
Text Extraction Quality Control: Integrate error-checking mechanisms to ensure that extracted text quality remains high, even with challenging document formats or scanned PDFs.
Language Detection and Translation: Add language detection and optional translation for documents, enabling users to upload files in multiple languages for analysis.

8. main2.py

Add a Configuration Dashboard: Implement a configuration dashboard or commands to allow admins to customize bot settings (e.g., AI model parameters, command prefix, language settings) without modifying the code.
Automated Command Documentation: Integrate a command to generate automated documentation for each bot command, keeping users informed about available functionalities.
Multi-Bot Integration: Extend the bot’s ability to interact with other bots, allowing it to delegate or share tasks for enhanced functionality.
Improved Error Logging: Enhance error logging to capture specific issues during bot initialization or during high-level command handling, helping in debugging and support.

9. milvus_handler.py

Add Vector Similarity Tuning: Allow admins to adjust vector similarity thresholds for improved query relevance based on user feedback.
Scheduled Vector Cleanup: Implement a cleanup function to remove or archive outdated vectors periodically, ensuring optimal performance.
Enhanced Milvus Authentication: Add secure authentication features to protect Milvus access, especially in shared environments.
Redundancy and Failover Mechanisms: Add redundancy and failover options in case Milvus encounters downtime, improving overall system reliability.
